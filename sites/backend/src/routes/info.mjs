   * down.
   * However, people who write these posts are OK with their name being
   * associated with it, so we have added and 'author' field to the database.
   * People who have written such posts have that field set to true, and
   * this endpoint will return name/uuid info for them so that their name
   * can be shown, along with avatar and a link to their profile.
   *
   * Note that this does not require auth, this info is public.
